## Overview and Origin
### Dandelion 
Dandelion is an innovator in the health care data field, focused on acquiring real world data (RWD) with the objective of making health care data sets from real patients available for AI developers and life sciences companies in order to improve algorithms to reduce bias that tends to harm minority racial and ethnic groups, which in turn will improve care and outcomes for patients. Dandelion's mission to create access to vast amounts of real, anonymized health care data will allow players in the health care data and AI fields to utilize and create algorithms that can accurately represent the populations being served in health care. 

### Inspiration 
 Dandelion was founded 2020 (research paper states 2019) after Ziad Obermeyer, Sendhil Mullainathan, and others published a paper titled "Dissecting racial bias in an algorithm used to manage the health of populations", in which they discuss how the "U.S. health care system uses commercial algorithms to guide health decisions." A widely used algorithm was studied and their team found evidence of racial bias, specifically that Black patients with the same risk-level designations as their White counterparts were in reality sicker, thus at a higher risk than indicated. 
 The authors aimed to show how algorithms are incorrectly using data to identify patient needs, in one case, health costs are used as a proxy for health needs - the higher the cost, the higher the need. However, the authors found that because in reality, less money is spent on Black patients with the actual same level of medical need as their White counterparts, that Black patients are being portrayed as healthier than their sick White counterparts. These types of findings inspired the founders to focus on the data being used to train the algorithms, and believe that making that data more available will allow predictive models to more accurately portray the medical needs and conditions of patients and reduce overall bias.

### Funding 

Dandelion is a private venture capital-backed start-up that has raised $15 million from 6 investors. It is headquartered in New York, NY and has a total of 20 employees. It was in one seed round on January 1, 2023 and is currently generating revenue. Five of the six investors are the following: Convergent Ventures (San Francisco), Floating Point, Moxxie Ventures, Phoenix Venture Partners, and Primary Venture Partners.

## Business Activities

Dandelion Health "accelerates clinical development and commericialization by combining proprietary AI tools with the richest source of real world patient data." The aim is reduce bias and create deeper insights that can more accurately portray a patient's health profile and thus improve care and diagnoses. 

> Dandelion's multimodal _Real World Data Platform_ brings together clinical notes, images and waveforms from millions of patient records for the most comprehensive view of disease progression, treatment efficacy, and individual patient outcomes.

Dandelion's intended customers are AI developers working to create algorithms, and Dandelion aims to help them to reduce bias and create the most "accurate" algorithms possible to ensure bias from real world data is not perpetuated by the algorithms. Dandelion also has life sciences companies as crucial partners, those who are interested in utilizing the algorithms to support their trials, findings, and speed up their processes. This can allow drug trials to be sped up, collecting data from significantly large data sets will potentially reduce the time and money it takes for randomized controlled trials to reach helpful conclusions.

Its advantage over other competitors is the agreement Dandelion has with various health care providers throughout the country to use their real patient data (anonymized) in order to flesh out their platform. This effort of providing more data for historically underrepresented communities will allow for more accurate medical diagnoses and treatments for those aforementioned patients who may have otherwise been measured by metrics from other more represented communities.

## Landscape

#### AI in Healthcare Data

Dandelion is an AI and data focused company in the health care field. Dandelion has worked with Sharp HealthCare; Sanford Health in Sioux Falls, South Dakota; and Texas Health Resources to collect structed and unsructed data for more than 10 million patients.

#### Trends and Innovations

Fragmentation is a large issue. The large spread of medical data, in various formats, mediums, measurements, etc., all cause disorganization and prevent data from being streamlined and interpreted for a comprehensive profile. 

> Over the past five years, we've witnessed an explosion in FDA-cleared algorithms - over 1,000 are expected to be cleared by the end of 2024. Untold numbers of additional algorithms have been developed by academic researchers. But despite their potential to significantly impact patient care, most of these algorithms remain underutilized, gathering virtual dust in digital storage. The reasons are well-known by now: unclear ROI, concerns about performance and bias, limited reimbursement, and deployment challenges.

> Meanwhile, the barriers to developing new AI tools continue to fall as technology evolves, making it easier than ever to create and improve these algorithms. 

> So while the research on clinical AI moves forward rapidly, the commercialization of the products remains halting at best.

#### Competitors

Dandelion finds itself in a unique position in that its aim is also to provide their large datasets for free to AI Developers and life sciences companies with the collective goal of improving algorithms and reducing bias. However, as with any market, there are competitors in the health care, pharmaceutical, and AI fields. The following are some companies with similar profiles.

Company            |  About 
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
 Ayogo                     | "Transforming healthcare and empowering patients using behavioral economics, social psychology, and patient-centered software
 Encycle Therapuetics      | "A biopharmaceutical company exploiting a proprietary platform technology that enables the rapid synthesis of small-to-medium macrocycles."
 FGB Natural Products      | "A pharmaceutical company"
 Carta Biosciences         | "A company developing AI-based technologies for drug discovery."

#### Results and measurements of success

  Data access: Various forms of patient data (charts, records, tests, measurements) can all vary greatly and make it difficult to interpret. Dandelion aims to train algorithms to interpret this data and come up with comprehensive profiles for patients. 

 > Data harmonization: At this level of granularity there is little consistency in the nomenclature used to describe, for example, specific blood tests (see, for example, this chart from the CDC outlining the 50+ ways to describe the units of common blood tests). 

  > Data interpretation: Since much of the data generated is unstructured, it has traditionally required expensive clinicians to carefully abstract the data into structured formats that can be used for analytical purposes.

Dandelion sees success as AI allowing life sciences companies to bring new drugs to market more efficiently, but this is still in its infancy, and as such, results and metrics are not readily obtainable. 

>Dandelion’s Clinical AI Marketplace sits at a new intersection of supply and demand in clinical AI. On the supply side, there’s an ever-growing list of AI developers producing algorithms that are primarily intended for clinical practice but which can also be applied for analytical purposes. On the demand side, life sciences companies are eager to harness AI to make the process of bringing new drugs to market more efficient, but for most players these efforts are in their infancy and have yet to show clear results.

## Recommendations

Dandelion is focused on providing real world data sets to AI developers and predictive algorithms to life sciences companies, and as such, it may be useful to continue tracking patients' medical history over time.  One idea for Dandelion is to implement a medical chatbot assistant to help track a patient's continued progress and history over time. As Dandelion works on standardizing data for interpretation by AI and algorithms, it can take a step towards future possibilities by initially capturing new patient data through an app that could connect Dandelion's data platform with the health care facility working with the patient. By utilizing large-language models (LLMs), the "Dandelion chatbot" could learn to communicate with the patient on a regular basis and capture data that might otherwise be missed by a healt care professional. Examples include: missed medications - the patient can log that and the data will hopefully track any adverse effects down the line, interactions with various different medications, pictures of physical conditions worsening or bettering over time (with precautions to not identify). The app/chatbot can send anonymized surveys based on conditions/illnesses the patients have to see how their conditions change over time. These narratives that were otherwise difficult to capture day by day will be easier to organize and produce eventual results for treatment plans, diagnoses, prescriptions, etc. By capturing data from populations that may not visit medical facilities often, this would improve on the lack of data sets for minority groups, thus improving treatment, and potentially bettering the relationship between these groups and the medical community at large.
